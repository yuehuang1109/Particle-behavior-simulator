# Particle-behavior-simulator
A 2D particle collision simulator built with Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib, featuring elastic collisions and interactive parameter control.

This is a TERM PROJECT wriiten to focus on
- 2d elastic collision and its physic behavior.
- OOP (class particle)
- Interative UI

Features
- 2D particle moving and collision
- elastic collision between particles, also with collision between particle and wall
- Interactive UI using Matplotlib
- Adjustable parameters, include "Radius", "Mass", "Elastic coeffcient", "Area size", "Number of particle"
- Pause and resume
- Reset system with new initiail conditions

REQs
- python
- numpy
- matplotlib
